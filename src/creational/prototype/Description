Idea: Given an object of some class, create a copy of it
why:
1. Given an object of some class, create a copy of it

Implementation:
1. Approach is to have copy constructor
2. But with copy constructor, we have a problem of child classes.
Eg: Student <- IntelligentStudent
Student stCopy = new Student(intelligentStudent) // Problem, so have to know prior what type of student it is
3. Ideal solution is to outsource copy work to object itself instead of client doing it.
Eg: Student stCopy = intelligentStudent.copy()

Hence have a copy method in object(general one is clone())

4. Maintain a registry of all prototypes and using any single prototype to copy and create new object out of it
