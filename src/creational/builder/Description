Idea: Have a separate builder class for building an object
why:
1. A class with lot of attributes
2. Want to validate object before creating it
3. If we have constructor with all attributes but there is a chance that client might not pass all attributes in the same manner constructor is expecting and is prone to errors
4. With constructors, we might have to pass null values if those attributes need not to be initialized for that object or create constructor with different combinations of attributes
